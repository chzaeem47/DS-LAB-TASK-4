I mainly worked on implementing and stabilizing the Linked List and Stack operations of the project.
Through this project, I learned how data structures like stacks can be used for real-life features such as undo operations.
I also improved my understanding of debugging pointer-related issues and infinite loops.
If I had one more week, I would add file handling to permanently save student records.
